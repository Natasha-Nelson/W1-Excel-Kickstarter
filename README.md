# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview
This analysis is a deep dive into the drivers of success and failure of Kickstarter campaigns. This analysis is intended to provide insight into key trends in how kickstarter campaigns perform across a few key metrics. This analysis evalutes the relationship outcomes based on campaign goals and outcomes based on launch date. While the overall data set includes multiple categories of categories of campaigns, this analysis focuses on the Theater and Play categories/subcategories.

## Analysis and Challenges
Our first goal was to assess how Theater outcomes are impacted by the launch date of the campaign. In the chart below, we have mapped the number of campaigns launched in a given month according to the outcome. This includes campaigns launched in multiple geographies and all Theater subcategories (musicals, plays, etc.) In the accompanying Excel File (Kickstarter_Challenge), this chart can be filtered by year to show trends between 2009 and 2017. The following chart aggregates outcomes over the entire eight year period for the initial data set.

Our second goal was to drill down further into the Play subcategory to understand this subcategory in greater detail. In the chart below, we have mapped the percentage of a given outcome relative to campaign goal size. This chart describes how many campaigns had a particular outcome compared to the number of launched within that bucket. For this analysis, we have grouped campaigns in buckets between a range of $5000. This chart includes campaigns launched in multiple geogrpahies. Of note, the first bucket includes all campaigns with a goal less than $1,000 and the final bucket includes all campaigns with goals above $50,000.

### Challenges
A challenge in the creation of both charts was the existence of 'live' campaigns within the data set. As the goal of this analysis is to understand how campaigns perform overtime, these data points were appropriately eliminated. Another potential challenged faced in running the analysis for the outcomes vs goals was the potential to unintentially omit campaigns on the boundary. This challenge was overcome through the inclusion of ">=" and "<=" within the COUNTIFS functions. It proved helpful to double check the functions by creating a final column to count all successful, failed and canceled plays and comparing this to the sum of all functions within the category (ie. Kickstarter_Challenge!Outcomes Based on Goals E14 is equal to both SUM(E2:E13) and SUM(B14:D14).

## Results
As seen in the preliminary phases of analysis, Theater campaigns are most successful when launched in May and June. This spike tapers off dramatically in the next few months with the lowest values in December. Comparatively, canceled and failed campaigns remain fairly consistent in numbers across the year, though are less consistent in the fourth quarter. The overall shapes of the successful and failed trend lines are fairly similar, so this chart is unclear as to whether the spike in successful campaigns in May/June is being driven by an increased number of new campaigns or the launch month itself. 

As one might intiute, the campaigns the have the highest chance of success relative to their goals are smaller in scale. We can see that the percentage of successful campaignss is higher than or equal to 50% for the first five buckets. Intriguingly, the overall pattern seems to be disrupted for the '35000 to 39999' and '40000 to 44999' buckets. One drawback of this chart is that it does not indicate the number of values within each bucket. Of note, the two buckets previously noted represent only 9 values within a set of 1047. 

In summary, we've found that the relevant campaigns segements under analysis tend to be most successful when launched in the middle of the year and have a goal under $5,000. However, there are a few limitations and dataset utilized. It is worth noting that the analysis was conducted across multiple geographies but no consideration to currency coversation rates (eg. the data assumes that all goal and pledge values are in the same currency). We also have access to a limited number of datapoints, meaning that the analysis will be less robust the further we drill down into a category (Theater) and subcategory (Plays). 

Moving forward, it would also be worth examining if the trend in increased success in May/June is consistent across the entire 8 year period within the data set or is being skewed by any particular year. I would also recommend adding charts to demonstrate whether the three trends identified above are consistent with Kickstarter campaigns across categories or if there are particular nuances in Theater/Play categories that should be explored.
